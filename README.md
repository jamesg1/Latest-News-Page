# Latest News Project
A small page I made in 2016 for a news.com.au interview using gulp, sass, bourbon, BEM and jQuery.

To develop on the project you will require Node.JS with NPM.

1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) the latest version of Node.JS and NPM.
2. `npm install`.
3. `npm run start`.
